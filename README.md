# California-Apiary-Locations-and-Pollinator-Dependant-Crops
## README

This project presents an interactive map visualizing **apiary locations across California** alongside **county-level percentages of pollinator-dependent crop acreage**. The map was inspired by a USDA article discussing the critical role migratory pollination plays in supporting California’s almond industry and other crops.

### Purpose of the Map
- Where apiaries are located throughout the state  
- Which counties have higher proportions of pollinator-dependent crops  
- How these two distributions overlap to illustrate potential demand and pollination pressure  

### Important Data Notes
This map uses **non-comprehensive datasets**:
- The crop percentages represent only the *accumulative acreage* of several key pollinator-dependent crops, not all such crops grown in California.  
- The apiary points reflect a *snapshot* of available public and voluntary data, meaning many apiaries—commercial and private—are not included.

Because of these limitations, the map is best interpreted as a **general visualization** rather than a complete inventory.

### Why It Matters
Even with partial datasets, combining these layers offers meaningful insight into the spatial relationship between pollination resources and agricultural reliance on pollinators. The map helps illustrate broad regional patterns, potential hotspots of pollination demand, and areas where apiary presence aligns—or does not align—with crop needs.
